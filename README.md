# About

This is a super-simple add-on to hide the new Dragonflight profession appearances.

As opposed to using the in-game NPC, the add-on can hide the profession gear right after the activity (mining, skinning) finishes channeling. [see screenshot 1]

You can also set the option to completely remove all profession gear & tool appearances instantly, allowing your currently equipped weapon to be visible during the crafting/gathering activity. [see screenshot 2]

All of the current profession appearances are supported:

   * Alchemy (Spark of Madness)
   * Blacksmithing (Suited For Smithing)
   * Jewelcrafting (An Eye For Shine)
   * Enchanting (A Looker's Charm)
   * Engineering (A Production-Grade Display)
   * Inscription (Artist's Duds)
   * Leatherworking (Sculpting Leather Finery)
   * Tailoring (Wrapped Up In Weaving)
   * Cooking (What's Cookin', Good Lookin'?)
   * Fishing (Fishing For Attention)
   * Herbalism (A Cultivator's Colors)
   * Mining (Rockin' Mining Gear)
   * Skinning (Dressed To Kill)


## How to use

Just install the add-on, and your are done.

You can enable/disable the add-on from the in-game "Addons" menu
important: due to Blizzard API restrictions, the add-on cannot remove the profession appearances while you are in-combat, but it will remove them as soon as you exit combat
